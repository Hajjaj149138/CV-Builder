## 💡 Why This Project?
Most modern CV builders prioritize "flashy" designs over functionality. Unfortunately, **75% of resumes are rejected** by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) because they use complex layouts, images, or non-selectable text that bots cannot read.

**This tool solves that.** It generates clean, semantic HTML-based PDFs that ensure your data is perfectly readable by both human recruiters and AI screening bots.

## ✨ Key Features
- **⚡ Real-Time Preview:** Watch your A4-formatted CV update instantly as you type.
- **🤖 ATS-Optimized:** Built with semantic tags (`<h1>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`)—no canvas, no flat images.
- **📥 True PDF Export:** Downloads as a professional PDF with **fully selectable text**.
- **🔒 Privacy First:** Your data never leaves your browser. No database, no accounts.
- **🛠️ Dynamic Sections:** Add/remove work experience, projects, and skills with one click.
