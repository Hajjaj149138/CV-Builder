## 💡 Why This Project?
Did you know that **75% of resumes are rejected** by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) before a human recruiter even sees them? 

Most online CV builders generate resumes as flat images or complex layouts that "bots" cannot read. **ATS-Friendly CV Builder** generates clean, semantic HTML-based PDFs, ensuring your skills and experience are 100% readable by top-tier company screening software.

## ✨ Key Features
- **⚡ Instant Live Preview:** See your A4-formatted CV update in real-time as you type.
- **🤖 Bot-Optimized:** Uses standard semantic tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<ul>`)—no canvas or image-based text.
- **📥 High-Quality PDF:** Downloads as a genuine PDF with **fully selectable text** for maximum compatibility.
- **🔒 Privacy First:** Your data never leaves your browser. We don't store your personal info.
- **🛠️ Fully Dynamic:** Add or remove jobs, projects, and skills with ease.
